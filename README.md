<!--About The Solution -->
## About The Solution

I used Functional Programming this time. There are two different approaches to coding:
* General: The least language-specific approach
* Python specific: Comprehensions

Each approach solves the algorithmical part in 3 steps. For better understanding I created a diagram.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

There are two recommended ways to run this project.
* Run the project from your IDE
* You can also add your input.txt:
        1. Go to the VaultHomework folder where main.py is located and add your file.
    2. Specify the file location with CLI:
     ```sh
     dotnet run yourfilename.txt
     ```
* Docker container: Navigate to the root folder of the repo where Dockerfile is located.
1. Build the docker image: 
    ```sh
    docker build -t vaulthomework .
    ```
2. Run the docker container:
    ```sh
    docker run --rm vaulthomework
    ```

<!-- Code coverage -->
### Code coverage 
* Manually opening from your local env. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/4UYAoUO.png">Â» VaultHomework/htmlcov/index.html</a>
* How to generate a new report?
1. Generate coverage data:
    ```sh
    python -m coverage run -m unittest
    ```
2. Coverage data into report:

    ```sh
    python -m coverage report
    ```
3. Generate Code coverage as html:
    ```sh
    python -m coverage html 
    ```

<!-- Python unittest Test -->
### Python unittest Test

In total, there are 11 unit tests.
